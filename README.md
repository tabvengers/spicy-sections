# oui-panelset

This repository is part of an effort within [Open UI](https://open-ui.org) toward a possible proposal for a native HTML solution to provide authors with a few basic controls, reconizably commonly referred to as "tabsets", "disclosure widgets" and "accordions" (a group of exclusive disclosures).

The purpose of the repository is to provide a 'close to parity' custom element refernce implementation which allows us to discover challenges, discuss details, demonstrate solutions, incentivize wide trial and feedback and generally help us arrive at good proposals with a nice trail, developed in the open.

** As this is a developing proposal, the surface and features are subject to change before such a proposal is made. **
