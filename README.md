# spicy-sections

**Spicy Sections** is an experiment in which "_good ol’ well supported HTML_" is conditionally presented with [different affordances](https://bkardell.com/blog/DesignAffordanceControls.html);
either as a tab set, or with independent collapses ("_disclosure widgets_") or exclusive collapses ("_accordions_").

**Spicy Sections** uses a custom element wrapper (`<spicy-sections>`) to wrap and progressively enhance heading and content pairs.

If you want to see something working, [check out this demonstration](https://codepen.io/bkardell/pen/VwpJGGL?editors=1100) and resize your browser window to see how the afforances change.

## Usage

Import the custom element.

```html
<script type="module" src="/SpicySections.js"></script>
```

Markup sections by wrapping _good ol’ HTML_ with the `<spicy-sections>` element.

```html
<spicy-sections>
  <!-- any heading here, followed by an element containing content -->
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <div>A list of ingredients</div>

  <!-- repeat the pattern... -->
  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <div>A list of instructions</div>
</spicy-sections>
```

## Affordances

**Spicy Sections** lets authors to express when affordances should be presented;
using either an attribute or a CSS Custom Property.
The available affordancs are `collapse` (_summary/details like_), `tab-bar` (_tabs like_) and `exclusive-collapse` (_single select accordion like).

To present an afforance of `collapse` on a smaller screen, you might use `[screen and (max-width: 800px)] collapse`.

```pcss
spicy-sections {
  --const-mq-affordances:
    [screen and (max-width: 40em) ] collapse |
    [screen and (min-width: 60em) ] tab-bar
  ;
  display: block;
  border: thick var(--demo-border, solid black);
  border-width: thick 0;
  padding: 1em;
}
```

_Note: The CSS Custom Property is only read only._

This custom element isn't itself a proposal.

It is something which we can use to roughly evaluate the concept an element which could conditionally present different interaction affordances, in much the same way scroll panes do in the web platform today.

There are many efforts happening in parallel discussing precisely how this should (and shouldn't or can and can't) work, but we'd love feedback about the crux of the idea itself.

Please check it out: Play with it. Build something useful. Ask questions, show us your uses, [give us feedback](https://github.com/tabvengers/spicy-sections/issues) about what you like or don't.

## Note

This element builds on progressive enhancement.
The resolution of module scripts is non-blocking and the display of different affordances can be quite different.
It is appealing then to minimize FOUC, and the one instrument that custom elements and CSS currently provide is `:not(:defined)`.

Unfortunately, using `:not(:defined)` to hide content fails to progressively enhance if the script fails to either load or execute;
this is an [known issue](see https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/6231).
For now, you can improve the experience by hiding the content when the script is enabled, and then _race_ the definition.

```js
// dynamically inject styles to hide the content
let style = document.head.appendChild(
  Object.assign(document.createElement('style'), {
    textContent: 'spicy-sections:not(:defined) { visibility: hidden; }'
  })
);

setTimeout(() => style.remove(), 1000);
```
